      - Flew from Toliara to Tana. What to say about Air Madagascar - the airline
        usually runs on Malagasy time and this was no exception. Flight was due to
        leave at 18.25. By 19.00 no plane had turned up and there was absolutely nobody
        in the terminal with any kind of information. There are screens in the terminal
        but as there is only 1 flight per day they are of little use. Fortunately
        TLE has a fairly modern terminal (for Madagascar) and a number of places to
        buy drinks. 8pm came and went then 9pm still no plane and it's getting dark.
        Eventually at about half past 9 three guys arrived in a jeep proceeded to
        drive down the runway setting up a series of cones with lights on top. The
        first we knew anything was happening was when a plane appeared on the runway
        taxied up to the terminal and unloaded some passengers. We were then allowed
        out onto the tarmac and up the steps to the plane. Plane was a fairly modern
        737 seats were reasonably comfortable staff were very friendly and as the
        plane was only half full the flight was one of the most pleasant I have had
        on AirMad. Flying with AirMad is always an experience.
      - '  The flight was fine and punctual and the service was good. It is incredible
        that an international airline does not offer vegetarian food. I tried to reserve
        it but the process was too complicated, and there were no options on the flight!'

      - Flew from Toliara to Tana. What to say about Air Madagascar - the airline
        usually runs on Malagasy time and this was no exception. Flight was due to
        leave at 18.25. By 19.00 no plane had turned up and there was absolutely nobody
        in the terminal with any kind of information. There are screens in the terminal
        but as there is only 1 flight per day they are of little use. Fortunately
        TLE has a fairly modern terminal (for Madagascar) and a number of places to
        buy drinks. 8pm came and went then 9pm still no plane and it's getting dark.
        Eventually at about half past 9 three guys arrived in a jeep proceeded to
        drive down the runway setting up a series of cones with lights on top. The
        first we knew anything was happening was when a plane appeared on the runway
        taxied up to the terminal and unloaded some passengers. We were then allowed
        out onto the tarmac and up the steps to the plane. Plane was a fairly modern
        737 seats were reasonably comfortable staff were very friendly and as the
        plane was only half full the flight was one of the most pleasant I have had
        on AirMad. Flying with AirMad is always an experience.
      - '  The flight was fine and punctual and the service was good. It is incredible
        that an international airline does not offer vegetarian food. I tried to reserve
        it but the process was too complicated, and there were no options on the flight!'

      - '  Chandigarh to Bhopal via Delhi. My mother was on wheelchair. They took
        her for boarding and as i along with other passengers were about to board
        they suddenly announced the cancellation of flight. I did not know the whereabouts
        of my mum and when i asked they repeatedly told me that they were going to
        bring her back. She did not arrive even after a wait of an hour and a half.
        Finally my wife went back to the check in counter after going reverse through
        the security and completing all the formalities and found her there. She told
        us that she was sitting in the wheelchair for about half an hour near the
        plane in rain as it started raining suddenly. There was a big confusion among
        the staff about the cancellation of the flight. The Delhi flight was announced
        again but they told us that we cannot board the flight as we would not be
        able to catch our flight for Bhopal due to delay in the Chandigarh flight.
        We then awaited for our luggage to come back for another three hours only
        to find that half of our luggage was not removed from the flight and it had
        been taken to Delhi. No one was telling us anything during all this as their
        whole staff was itself confused and was in a panic mode. When i enquired about
        this from their supervisor he was making excuse like a school child that due
        to all this mess up and heavy rains they were not able to unload all the luggage
        of the passengers. I told him that if they were so untrained that they were
        not able to handle such a simple situation what will happen if they have to
        deal with a real emergency.'
      - Flew from Toliara to Tana. What to say about Air Madagascar - the airline
        usually runs on Malagasy time and this was no exception. Flight was due to
        leave at 18.25. By 19.00 no plane had turned up and there was absolutely nobody
        in the terminal with any kind of information. There are screens in the terminal
        but as there is only 1 flight per day they are of little use. Fortunately
        TLE has a fairly modern terminal (for Madagascar) and a number of places to
        buy drinks. 8pm came and went then 9pm still no plane and it's getting dark.
        Eventually at about half past 9 three guys arrived in a jeep proceeded to
        drive down the runway setting up a series of cones with lights on top. The
        first we knew anything was happening was when a plane appeared on the runway
        taxied up to the terminal and unloaded some passengers. We were then allowed
        out onto the tarmac and up the steps to the plane. Plane was a fairly modern
        737 seats were reasonably comfortable staff were very friendly and as the
        plane was only half full the flight was one of the most pleasant I have had
        on AirMad. Flying with AirMad is always an experience.
      - '  The flight was fine and punctual and the service was good. It is incredible
        that an international airline does not offer vegetarian food. I tried to reserve
        it but the process was too complicated, and there were no options on the flight!'
